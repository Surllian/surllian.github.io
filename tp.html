                <h1>Overview:</h1>
                <p> As an advocator, it will be better if I can work with the another advocators or mediators. Working
                    with teammates that have same characteristic will be easier. I can freely express my idea about the
                    project and support another teammate in an effective way. In addition, When I can freely express my
                    thought about the upcoming project, it makes me feel motivated because my work is meaningful.
                    According to the 16Personalities, the advocate personality prefers not to think themselves as above
                    or below another people and this thought is very important when working in a group, teammates with
                    advocate personality, to be specific, will treat everyone equally and happy to contribute their
                    thought on the group discussion, and it will be easier for a leader to control the group’s
                    moderation and accommodate when conflict happens. Secondly according to the 16Personalities,
                    mediators take pride in being honest and doing the right things in all circumstances. In other
                    words, this characteristic is very necessary when working on the group assignment, it helps people
                    to judge and evaluate the situation to take the right action other than listen to the instruction
                    from another people, they will considerate what is right and wrong and try their best to bring the
                    work to the perfection. Moreover, honest is very importance when participating in group work, an
                    honest teammate will improve the trust between teammates and bring the harmony atmosphere to the
                    group. For those reasons, I prefer to work with advocators and mediators than another type of
                    personality.

                    <p>Thu is an ‘Idea Realizer’ and also a hardworking person. As for an ‘Idea Realizer’, she will try
                        her best to realize the group idea by searching for tools and technologies, which make the idea
                        is possible to execute. As for a hardworking person, she can scarify her sleeping time to keep
                        the project on track, accelerate the group productivity, or join in the late group meeting
                        (around 11:00 p.m. - 0:00 a.m.). Sometimes, she can lose her temper and talk quite louder than
                        usually. However, after that she calm herself and participating in a group project normally.
                        Despite Thu can easily get angry, I enjoyed the time working group project with her and wish to
                        collaborate more with her in the future.

                        qualification is quite high. If we are in the same group, I will suggest other teammate to
                        promote her to be a group secretary. As a secretary, Trang can aplly her listen skill and
                        improve her group communication by participating more productively on group discussion.
